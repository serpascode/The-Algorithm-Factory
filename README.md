# The-Algorithm-Factory
A Website Written by Luis Serpas
with the help of Spring and Thymeleaf.
It visualizes a set of Sorting Algorithms.

Using a set of Thymeleaf 'fragments' as the front end
for each of the Sorting Sequences. 

This web app that incorporates Thymeleaf
https://www.thymeleaf.org/
as a templating engine.

Here is an Example of 
Another implemenation of sorting animations. I used this for visual comparison
https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms

Using Bootstrap4, along with HTML5 & css3 It will be a visual representation of sorting algorithms 
and will allow the user to cycle through the offered Algorithms.

Explains in further detail the 3 main components that work in conjunction with Javascript. 
i.e. The Call Stack, the Web Api's, and the Event Queue.
