# The-Algorithm-Factory
A Website Created with Spring Boot to Visualize Sorting Algorithms.

This web app that incorporates Thymeleaf
https://www.thymeleaf.org/
as a templating engine.

It its a casestudy of a the Factory Design Pattern and will use a series of 
Sorting Algorithms implemented in Java.

Another implemenation of sorting animations (for comparison)

Using Bootstrap4, along with HTML5 & css3 It will be a visual representation of sorting algorithms 
and will allow the user to cycle through the offered Algorithms.

Explains in further detail the 3 main components that work in conjunction with Javascript. 
i.e. The Call Stack, the Web Api's, and the Event Queue.
